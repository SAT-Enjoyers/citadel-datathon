# Plan

## Things to revise 
- Pandas
- Stats
- Seaborn / Matplotlib
- Keras

## During Datathon
- We are given a number of datasets - brainstorm ideas for each of them and then choose the dataset
- Once a dataset is chosen, briefly analyse data and make a hypothesis
- Do in depth data analysis to support this hypothesis
- Make as many graphs as possible
- Model the data using AI

## Workflow
- Make sure everyone has a working python environment with the same version of python, keras, sklearn and pandas (as well as any other libraries)
- Agree on code formatting / use linter
- Setup repo
- Typing - docstring
- Use jupyter notebooks at the end
- Pair programming
- One branch per pair
- Document everything
